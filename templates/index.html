<p>
	I 'm a web developer. I've been making websites on and off since 2017. I
	usually use a lot of JavaScript but I chose to make this website
	completely without it. You can find the source for this website on
	<a href="https://github.com/ebinbellini/ebinbellini">GitHub</a>.
	The fonts used are
	<a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-english-font.html">IM FELL
		English</a>, which is digitally reproduced by
	<a href="https://iginomarini.com">Igino Marini</a>, and
	<a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/typographerwoodcutinitialsone-font.html">
		Typographer Woodcut Initials One</a>, which is made by
	<a href="http://www.steffmann.de">Dieter Steffmann</a>.

	Other than web development, I make all kinds of designs. You can find
	some of them on the <a href="/works/design/">Design</a> page. My other
	hobbies include photography, programming, Linux, biking, judo,
	languages, and piano. I put my photographs on the
	<a href="/works/gallery/">Gallery</a> page, but the other hobbies
	haven't quite made it onto this site yet. Maybe someday I'll write more
	about some of those here.
