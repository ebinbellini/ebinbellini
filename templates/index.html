	I'm a web developer currently in education. I've been making websites on and off since 2017. I usually use a lot of
	javascript but I chose to make this website completely without it. You can find some examples of my other works on
	the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page.
</p>
<p>
	Other than web development, I make all kinds of designs. You can find some of them on the <a
		href="/design/">Design</a> page, and some on the on the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page.
</p>
<p>
	My other hobbies include photography, programming, Linux, biking, judo, languages, and piano. I put my
	photographs on the <a href="/gallery">Gallery</a> page, but the other hobbies haven't made it onto this site yet.
	Maybe someday I'll write more about some of those here.
