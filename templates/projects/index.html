	<p>
		SAS Virtual Group is a virtual airline. They use flight simulation software to as accurately as possible
		simulate real world airlines. SAS Virtual Group in particular only flies the same routes and aircrafts as
		the real-life airline SAS. This website helps them submit reports of their flights, track how much they
		fly, view the available routes, view announcements from the virutal airline's staff, and more, all in one place.

	<p>
		Runyonii is a web app where you can chat with a friend or groups of them. It features offline persistence,
		which means it caches it's contents so that it can be accessed without the internet. It can send
		notifications when you recieve messages, although it doesn't always work. A built in game is planned,
		where you can plant flowers on a real world map and water your friends flowers. Sort of like a mix between
		Ingress and Animal Crossing.
